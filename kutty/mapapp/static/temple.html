Temple is main deity is lorn Murugan, who us worshipped as the god of war and handsome young man ridinga peacock with six faces
 and twelve arms.Very Devine! A must visit for Murugan devotees. Temple on top of small hillock. Surrounding views are good.
The temple architecture is a fine example of the dravidian and there is a big murugan statue at the entrance.
In the temple is beautiful and it was located in the hillock. And it was the famous temple in the tamil nadu.
